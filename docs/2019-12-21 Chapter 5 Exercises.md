## 5.7 Exercises

1. Using a list comprehension, give an expression that calculates the sum $1^2+2^2+\ldots+100^2$ of the first one hundred integer squares.

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    sum100ConsecSquares :: Int
    sum100ConsecSquares = sum [x^2 | x <- [1..100]]
    ```

2. Suppose that a coordinate grid of size $m\times n$ is given by the list of all pairs $(x, y)$ of integers such that $0\leq x\leq m$ and $0\leq y\leq n$. Using a list comprehension, define a function `grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int,Int)]` that returns a coordinate grid of a given size. For example:

    ```haskell
    > grid 1 2
    [(0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(1,2)]
    ```

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int,Int)]
    grid m n = [(x,y) | x <- [0..m], y <- [0..n]]
    ```

3. Using a list comprehension and the function grid above, define a function `square :: Int -> [(Int,Int)]` that returns a coordinate square of size $n$, excluding the diagonal from $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$. For example:

    ```haskell
    > square 2
    [(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,2),(2,0),(2,1)]
    ```

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int,Int)]
    grid m n = [(x,y) | x <- [0..m], y <- [0..n]]

    square :: Int -> [(Int,Int)]
    square n = [(x,y) | (x,y) <- grid n n, x /= y]
    ```

4. In a similar way to the function length, show how the library function `replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]` that produces a list of identical elements can be defined using a list comprehension. For example:

    ```haskell
    > replicate 3 True
    [True,True,True]
    ```

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]
    replicate n x = [x | _ <- [1..n]]
    ```

5. A triple $(x,y,z)$ of positive integers is Pythagorean if it satisfies the equation $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$. Using a list comprehension with three generators, define a function `pyths :: Int -> [(Int,Int,Int)]` that returns the list of all such triples whose components are at most a given limit. For example:

    ```haskell
    > pyths 10
    [(3,4,5),(4,3,5),(6,8,10),(8,6,10)]
    ```

    By adding in the constraints that $a\leq b\leq c$ we can uniquely generated pythagorean triplets which are unique up to rotation.

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    pyths :: Int -> [(Int,Int,Int)]
    pyths n = [(a,b,c) | c <- [1..n],
                        b <- [1..c],
                        a <- [1..b],
                        a^2 + b^2 == c^2]
    ```

6. A positive integer is perfect if it equals the sum of all of its factors, excluding the number itself. Using a list comprehension and the function factors, define a function `perfects :: Int -> [Int]` that returns the list of all perfect numbers up to a given limit. For example:

    ```haskell
    > perfects 500
    [6,28,496]
    ```

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    factors :: Int -> [Int]
    factors n = [x | x <- [1..n], n `mod` x == 0]

    perfects :: Int -> [Int]
    perfects n = [x | x <- [1..n],
                    x == sum (factors x) - ]
    ```

7. Show how the list comprehension `[(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]]` with two generators can be re-expressed using two comprehensions with single generators. Hint: nest one comprehension within the other and make use of the library function `concat :: [[a]] -> [a]`.

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    list1 :: [(Int,Int)]
    list1 =  concat [[(x,y) | y <- [3,4]] | x <- [1,2]]
    ```

8. Redefine the function positions using the function find.

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    find :: Eq a => a -> [(a,b)] -> [b]
    find k t = [v | (k',v) <- t, k == k']

    positions :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Int]
    positions x xs = [i | (x',i) <- zip xs [0..], x == x']

    positions' :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Int]
    positions' x xs = find x (zip xs [0..])
    ```

9. The scalar product of two lists of integers `xs` and `ys` of length $n$ is given by the sum of the products of corresponding integers:

    $$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} xs_i \cdot ys_i$$

    In a similar manner to `chisqr`, show how a list comprehension can be used to define a function `scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int` that returns the scalar product of two lists. For example:

    ```haskell
    > scalarproduct [1,2,3] [4,5,6]
    32
    ```

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    chisqr :: [Float] -> [Float] -> Float
    chisqr os es = sum [((o-e)^2)/e | (o,e) <- zip os es]

    scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int
    scalarproduct xs ys = sum [x*y | (x,y) <- zip xs ys]
    ```

10. Modify the Caesar cipher program to also handle upper-case letters.

    Solution:

    ```haskell
    -- We assume that the input is not only upper case letters.
    import Data.Char

    -- Returns a list of indices of the specifed value
    positions :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Int]
    positions x xs = [i | (x',i) <- zip xs [0..], x == x']

    -- Returns the number of lowercase characters
    lowers :: String -> Int
    lowers xs = length [x | x <- xs, 'a' <= x && x <= 'z']

    -- Returns the number of occurences
    count :: Char -> String -> Int
    count x xs = length [x' | x' <- xs, x == x']

    -- Converts a character into an integral value
    -- Specifically, it maps [a..z]++[A..Z] to the interval [0..51]
    let2int :: Char -> Int
    let2int c | 'a' <= c && c <= 'z' = ord c - ord 'a'
            | 'A' <= c && c <= 'Z' = ord c - ord 'A' + 26
            | otherwise            = ord c

    -- Converts an integral value into a character
    int2let :: Int -> Char
    int2let n | n <= 25 = chr (ord 'a' + n)
            | n <= 51 = chr (ord 'A' - 26 + n)
            | otherwise = chr n

    shift :: Int -> Char -> Char
    shift n c 
        | isLower c = int2let ((let2int c + n) `mod` 26)
        | isUpper c = int2let (((let2int c + n - 26) `mod` 26) + 26)
        | otherwise = c

    encode :: Int -> String -> String
    encode n xs = [shift n x | x <- xs]

    -- Frequency distribution of lowercase english letters
    table :: [Float]
    table = [8.1, 1.5, 2.8, 4.2, 12.7, 2.2, 2.0, 6.1, 7.0,
            0.2, 0.8, 4.0, 2.4, 6.7, 7.5, 1.9, 0.1, 6.0,
            6.3, 9.0, 2.8, 1.0, 2.4, 0.2, 2.0, 0.1]

    percent :: Int -> Int -> Float
    percent n m = (fromIntegral n / fromIntegral m) * 100

    -- Only necessary to count the number of lowercase letters present.
    freqs :: String -> [Float]
    freqs xs = [percent (count x xs) n | x <- ['a'..'z']]
        where n = lowers xs

    chisqr :: [Float] -> [Float] -> Float
    chisqr os es = sum [((o-e)^2)/e | (o,e) <- zip os es]

    rotate :: Int -> [a] -> [a]
    rotate n xs = drop n xs ++ take n xs

    crack :: String -> String
    crack xs = encode (-factor) xs
        where
            factor = head (positions (minimum chitab) chitab)
            chitab = [chisqr (rotate n table') table | n <- [0..25]]
            table' = freqs xs
    ```
